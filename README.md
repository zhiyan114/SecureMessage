# What is SecureMessage?
A software that is used to encrypt your communication message. It's small and simple (maybe bigger because I used QT).
# Planned Update
- [X] Using RSA to encrypt data (i.e. Encrypt your data using both AES and RSA by only using your RSA public key)
- [X] Recovery Public key using a private key
- [X] RSA key encryption
- [X] Convert RSA certificate to RSA public key
- [X] Code Optimization (Current source code is too messy)
